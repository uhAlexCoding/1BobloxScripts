# 1BobloxScripts
These are scripts for loadstrings on the game "Roblox".

## INFO FOR GITHUB / MODERATORS
I'd like to say that these scripts aren't for "exploiting"/"breaking" the game of Roblox. These are only for experimental purposes just for **ME***.

## SCRIPTS

### Script Executor
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhAlexCoding/1BobloxScripts/main/script-executor.lua"))()
```
This is an executor named "Orange Executor (X)". Used to execute scripts such as a highlight script.
